## 1. Introduction to XGBoost algorithm


**XGBoost** stands for **Extreme Gradient Boosting**.  XGBoost is a powerful machine learning algorithm that is dominating the world of applied machine learning and Kaggle competitions. It is an implementation of gradient boosted trees designed for speed and accuracy.


**XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)** is an advanced implementation of the gradient boosting algorithm. It has proved to be a highly effective machine learning algorithm extensively used in machine learning competitions. XGBoost has high predictive power and is almost 10 times faster than other gradient boosting techniques. It also includes a variety of regularization parameters which reduces overfitting and improves overall performance. Hence, it is also known as **regularized boosting** technique.

## 2. XGBoost algorithm intuition


XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) belongs to a family of boosting algorithms. It uses the gradient boosting (GBM) framework at its core. So, first of all we should know about gradient boosting.


### Gradient boosting

Gradient boosting is a supervised machine learning algorithm, which tries to predict a target variable by combining the estimates of a set of simpler, weaker models. In boosting, the trees are built in a sequential manner such that each subsequent tree aims to reduce the errors of the previous tree. The misclassified labels are given higher weights.  Each tree learns from its predecessors and tries to reduce the residual errors. So, the tree next in sequence will learn from the previous tree residuals.


### XGBoost

In XGBoost, we try to fit a model on the gradient of the loss function generated from the previous step. So, in XGBoost we modified our gradient boosting algorithm so that it works with any differentiable loss function.

## 3. The problem statement

In this project, I try to solve a classification problem. The problem is to classify the customers from two different channels as Horeca (Hotel/Retail/Café) customers or Retail channel (nominal) customers. I implement XGBoost with Python and Scikit-Learn to solve the classification problem.

## 4. Dataset description

"""## 10. Train the XGBoost classifier


- Now, I will train the XGBoost classifier. We need to know different parameters that XGBoost provides. There are three types of parameters that we must set before running XGBoost. These parameters are as follows:-


### General parameters

These parameters relate to which booster we are doing boosting. The common ones are tree or linear model.


### Booster parameters

It depends on which booster we have chosen for boosting.


### Learning task parameters

These parameters decide on the learning scenario. For example, regression tasks may use different parameters than ranking tasks. 


### Command line parameters

In addition there are command line parameters which relate to behaviour of CLI version of XGBoost.


The most important parameters that we should know about are as follows:-


**learning_rate** - It gives us the step size shrinkage which is used to prevent overfitting. Its range is [0,1].

**max_depth** - It determines how deeply each tree is allowed to grow during any boosting round.

**subsample** - It determines the percentage of samples used per tree. Low value of subsample can lead to underfitting.

**colsample_bytree** - It determines the percentage of features used per tree. High value of it can lead to overfitting.

**n_estimators** - It is the number of trees we want to build.

**objective** - It determines the loss function to be used in the process. For example, `reg:linear` for regression problems, `reg:logistic` for classification problems with only decision, `binary:logistic` for classification problems with probability.


XGBoost also supports regularization parameters to penalize models as they become more complex and reduce them to simple models. These regularization parameters are as follows:-


**gamma** - It controls whether a given node will split based on the expected reduction in loss after the split. A higher value leads to fewer splits. It is supported only for tree-based learners.

**alpha** - It gives us the `L1` regularization on leaf weights. A large value of it leads to more regularization.

**lambda** - It gives us the `L2` regularization on leaf weights and is smoother than `L1` regularization.

Though we are using trees as our base learners, we can also use XGBoost’s relatively less popular linear base learners and one other tree learner known as `dart`. We have to set the `booster` parameter to either `gbtree` (default), `gblinear` or `dart`.

## 13. k-fold Cross Validation using XGBoost


To build more robust models with XGBoost, we must do k-fold cross validation. In this way, we ensure that the original training dataset is used for both training and validation. Also, each entry is used for validation just once. XGBoost supports k-fold cross validation using the `cv()` method. In this method, we will specify several parameters which are as follows:- 


**nfolds** - This parameter specifies the number of cross-validation sets we want to build. 

**num_boost_round** - It denotes the number of trees we build.

**metrics** - It is the performance evaluation metrics to be considered during CV.

**as_pandas** - It is used to return the results in a pandas DataFrame.

**early_stopping_rounds** - This parameter stops training of the model early if the hold-out metric does not improve for a given number of rounds.

**seed** - This parameter is used for reproducibility of results.

We can use these parameters to build a k-fold cross-validation model by calling `XGBoost's CV()` method.

"""`xgb_cv` contains train and test `auc` metrics for each boosting round. Let's preview `xgb_cv`."""

"""## 14. Feature importance with XGBoost


XGBoost provides a way to examine the importance of each feature in the original dataset within the model. It involves counting the number of times each feature is split on across all boosting trees in the model. Then we visualize the result as a bar graph, with the features ordered according to how many times they appear. 

XGBoost has a **plot_importance()** function that helps us to achieve this task. Then we can visualize the features that has been given the highest important score among all the features. Thus XGBoost provides us a way to do feature selection.

I will proceed as follows:-

"""

xgb.plot_importance(xgb_clf)
plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = [6, 4]
plt.show()

"""We can see that the feature `Grocery`  has been given the highest importance score among all the features. Thus XGBoost also gives us a way to do Feature Selection.
